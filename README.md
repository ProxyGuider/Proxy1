As someone who travels a lot and loves keeping up with my favorite UK shows, I was constantly frustrated by geo-restrictions on NOW TV. Every time I left the UK, I’d lose access to the content I was paying for. That’s when I started looking into proxies—and honestly, using one has completely changed the game.
